LED SIGN DIGITIZER
Code for digitalEmbodiment Project

This code uses wiringPi to control a 32x16 P10 LED sign (ebay) and display a webcam image.  I have to give tons of credit and thanks to Jonathan Andrews for his code for interfacing the sign and clocking in the pixels.  Much of the code logic was ported from his p10 test image code.  Also, thanks to Daniel Shiffman for his video threshold Processing example.  Understanding that is what helped me get this project started.
